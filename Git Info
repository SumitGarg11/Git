if u don't have ssh key then check it once 
ls -al ~/.ssh

This will list all SSH keys stored in your ~/.ssh directory.
Look for files like id_rsa and id_rsa.pub (or similar).
If you don't see them, you'll need to generate a new SSH key.

Generate an SSH Key (if you don't have one)
If you don't have an SSH key, generate one with the following command:

bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

after ssh done 
 add ssh to github 
check the public key 
  cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

after the copy it and do this task 


1. Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account
To connect your SSH key to GitHub, you need to add the public key (id_rsa.pub) to your GitHub account.

Hereâ€™s how:

Copy the public key to your clipboard by running this command:

bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
This will display the public key in your terminal. Copy the entire key that starts with ssh-rsa and ends with your email address.

Go to GitHub:

Sign in to your GitHub account.
Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner, and go to Settings.
In the left-hand sidebar, click SSH and GPG keys.
Click New SSH key.
Give it a title (something like "My Computer SSH Key").
Paste the public key you copied into the Key field.
Click Add SSH key.
2. Test the SSH Connection
After adding the key to GitHub, test the connection by running:

bash
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message like:

vbnet
Copy code
Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
